My name is Kartikay, and I am a software engineer. I made this tool to allow me to manipulate my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes from anywhere when I am on the terminal. 
It is also a good way for me to learn [Go](https://golang.org/).

If you have any feedback or feature requests, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Yakitrak/obsidian-cli/issues) or send me an [email](mailto:kartikayjainwal@gmail.com).
