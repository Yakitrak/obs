**Tip 1:** You never need to actually navigate to the vault directory unless you want to. And if you need to, use the [print-default-vault](/docs/commands/print-default-vault) command to get the path.
{: .notice--info}

**Tip 2:** When working with paths with spaces in them, you need to wrap them in quotes. For example, `obs open "My Note"` or `obs move "folder with space/My note" "new folder/new note name"`.
{: .notice--info}

**Tip 3:** You can rename files and update all links by using the [move](/docs/commands/move-note) command which will also rename all the links in other notes.
