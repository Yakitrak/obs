Hello, I'm Kartikay, a software engineer. I created this tool to conveniently manipulate my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes from the terminal, while also having fun learning [Go](https://golang.org/).

Obsidian CLI is not affiliated with Obsidian.md. It is a personal open source project.

If you have any feedback or feature requests, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Yakitrak/obsidian-cli/issues) or [email me](mailto:kartikayjainwal@gmail.com).
